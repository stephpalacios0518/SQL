#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE LENGTH(orderID)=6
AND orderID<>'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID), Product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE LENGTH(orderID)=6
AND orderID<> 'Order ID'
AND Product='iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum

INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Sales
ON customers.order_id=Sales.orderID
WHERE LENGTH(orderid)=6
AND orderid<>'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, ROUND(SUM(Quantity)*price,2) AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

--(Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).
SELECT Product, ROUND(SUM(Quantity)*price,2) AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;s
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(distinct customers.acctnum), ROUND(AVG(Quantity)*price) AS avg_spent
